# hello-world
my first day at GitHub

Hi, everybody,

i am a Chinese until now and work in Germany. I would like to do something that is meaningful, for example, go into the programming world. I will learn how to make an Apple APP. I think these APP can help me better my job and give suprise to my friends.

Thanks a lot!

now i am in my mother land China, I am proud of my country. 2017.7.28
